It was late afternoon.  
I hadn’t slept the night before.

I was sitting in the co-passenger seat of a truck I had been on trial with since morning. Work notifications kept buzzing endlessly. Somewhere in between them, two messages stood out.

> *“Hayloo, are you awake?”*

I replied, half-curious, half-irritated, asking why.  
The response came almost instantly:

> *“Can’t I just text?”*

That was it.

This person, someone I had initially written off as a *snobby Bandra kid*, had somehow found my number. Not too surprising in hindsight; she was HR after all. Still, the fact that *she* texted first caught me off guard.

She had joined our office as an interim HR back in March. She stayed for a week, then disappeared on a long leave, I honestly don’t remember for how long. The point is, we barely interacted during those initial months.

She sat in one corner of the bullpen.  
I sat on the opposite end.  
Our backs literally facing each other.

She mostly kept to herself, chatting with our then mutual friend **P**. They worked, whispered, occasionally glanced in my direction, and giggled. I noticed, but I was far too buried in my own work to care. Or so I told myself.

Then one day in April, purely to satisfy my daily caffeine and sugar quota, I ordered a couple of packets of Skittles.

She waddled over slowly to my desk.

“Can I have some?”

That “some” turned into *both packets*, finished over the course of a day or two.

And just like that, 
that’s where it started.

Not with a conversation.  
Not with intent.  
But with stolen Skittles and an unexpected text that simply asked:

*Can’t I just text?*
