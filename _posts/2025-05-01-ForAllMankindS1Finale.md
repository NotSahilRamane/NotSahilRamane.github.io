### *“We chose to go to the moon…”*  
*A voice from fiction that captures the real story of humanity’s drive to push forward.*


In *Sapiens*, Yuval Noah Harari describes humanity’s rise not as a product of physical superiority, but of imagination. We became the dominant species on Earth not because we were the strongest, but because we could tell stories—stories that helped us collaborate, plan, and believe in things we couldn’t yet see. In *Homo Deus*, Harari pushes that thought forward: as we master famine, war, and plague, the next frontier is no longer survival—it’s transcendence. We dream of becoming gods. Not metaphorically, but literally reshaping biology, engineering consciousness, and colonizing other worlds.

But that ambition doesn’t come without consequence. It never has.

The following monologue, delivered by Ellen Wilson in the finale of *For All Mankind* Season 1, captures that tension—the beauty and brutality of choosing progress. It’s fiction, yes. But it distills something very real: our species’ irrational resilience in the face of overwhelming risk, and our enduring belief that it’s all *still worth it*.

> **"Worth it? I mean it's dangerous. Lives have been lost, and, honestly, probably more will be lost. But every one of us knew the risks before we joined, the toll it takes on us, and on the ones we love. But we all signed up just the same.**  
>
> **It's the price we pay to push forward to explore the universe and wander into the unknown. Pushing ourselves to the limits of what's possible. Are there sacrifices that have to be made? Of course. But sacrifice is a part of any journey. It's like those caravans, the wagon trains that crossed our country a hundred years ago in search of a new home. Or the ships that sailed across the Atlantic in search of a new world. Taking on these great challenges against great odds—that's what makes us human.**  
>
> **Remember, we chose to go to the moon not because it was easy but because it was hard. So, yes. Yes, I think it's worth it. Because no matter how hard it is now, when we look to the future, we can see that things can... they can get better. I do believe that."**

This speech compresses centuries of human history into a few sentences. From ocean crossings to space travel, from myth to mission control—it’s always been the same story. Sacrifice. Vision. Forward motion.

Harari’s work frames this as the arc of *Homo sapiens* becoming *Homo deus*: endlessly dissatisfied, endlessly curious, always betting on a better future even when the present demands everything. Ellen’s words are a modern echo of that timeless mindset. She speaks not just as an astronaut, but as a stand-in for anyone who’s ever dared to say, *“There has to be more than this.”*

That belief—that the unknown is not something to fear, but to *reach for*—is perhaps the most human thing we have left. And in times where doubt feels louder than dreams, reminders like this one help us remember who we are.
