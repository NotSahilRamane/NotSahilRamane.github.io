Some stories don’t end — they simply stop being told.

And this one, perhaps, has reached the last page I’m brave enough to write for now.
But that doesn’t mean it’s over. Not truly.

It began eight years ago. A glance across a room, an afterthought in a conversation, a smile that stayed longer than it should have. It evolved — through silences, through waiting, through long-distance voids and spontaneous reunions. Through jealousy, through heartbreak, through growth.

Through time.

There’s a kind of love that’s less about possession and more about presence.
The kind where you're just grateful to know someone like that exists — and even more grateful that they allowed you to know them. Maybe that’s all this ever was. Maybe that’s all it needed to be.

She was never mine.
But in a way, she was never anyone else’s either.

In her orbit, I learned what longing can do to a man. How it can both break him and build him. I learned the weight of words unsaid, and the strange comfort of conversations that pick up years later like nothing happened — even when everything did.

I saw her in every season of my life — youth, ambition, heartbreak, rebuilding. And now, as I stand at the cusp of something new, she’s still there… not beside me, but somewhere between a memory and a melody.

Maybe that’s why this hurts more than it should. Not because of what we were, but because of what we almost were.

You don’t spend nearly a decade loving someone — even silently — without it leaving a mark.

And yet, love like this… it teaches you to love the way rain loves the earth. Without asking to stay. Without needing to be remembered for every drop. Just content to have touched something, however briefly.

Do I still love her?
Yes. Maybe not in the way I once did — not with the reckless hope of 2018 or the desperate ache of 2022.
Now, it’s quieter.
Like a familiar song that plays at the end of the night, long after everyone else has left the room.

She’s moving on. A new country. A new life. Perhaps, one day, a new name beside hers.
And I?
I’m still here. Trying to let go — not of her, but of the version of me that held onto her for so long.

There’s beauty in that too.

If she ever reads this, I hope she knows that she was loved deeply.
That someone thought of her in every silence, every city, every time the sky looked like the one we sat under.
That her presence shaped more than just a chapter — it carved the entire book.
